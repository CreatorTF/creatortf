> \--- about --- hxxpx : / /creator [.] tf/ \--- description follows --- Hello, my name is Daniel.
>
> I am the project lead of hxxpx : / /Creators.TF - a community driven project, purpose of which is to create new content for the online multiplayer game - Team Fortress 2. And a while ago we discovered an issue, that we would be grateful if you help us resolve.
>
> Our website is accessible through our main domain: creators.tf. Our visitors use it to check the news in our blog, manage their virtual item inventory and manage their quests and tasks that they may complete on our game servers.
>
> We value the trust of our users, and that's why we try to be as transparent with our users as possible. We do not generate any revenue from the site itself, all the content on the site is free of charge for every user. We only rely on our player's donations, which help us cover server costs for our website and servers.
>
> What is the issue?
>
> Around a year ago a former staff member registered an alias for our website - "hxxp : / /creator [.] tf" using the OVH domain registrar. This domain's purpose initially was to help users reach the main site, even if they type the name of the original domain incorrectly. This staff member was later removed from the team for hateful behaviour towards other staff members and our users. However, they refused to transfer ownership of the domain back to us, and decided to keep it.
>
> This domain has now been used to host misinformation, illegal content, and content that was maliciously posted to the public. Such as, dumps of our core database, source code of our website, and game server plugins. This raised a lot of privacy issues and concerns, that despite them all being addressed and resolved appropriately, still are damaging to us and our users' trust.
>
> Currently, this domain is hosting private information as well as transphobic and hateful content towards one of our staff team members, containing their real life images used without their consent. This issue still persists to this day and this content is still accessible from this domain name. This has resulted in several pernicious members of this domain to go after this said staff member by obtaining their full real name, address, and prank calling and threatening them and their parents.
>
> We respect the trust of our users as well as the privacy of our staff members, so we please ask you to help us stop the spread of this illegal content and misinformation by terminating this domain's activity immediately.
>
> Best Regards, Daniel.
